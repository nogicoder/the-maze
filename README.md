## Project title: MAZE
My first project in the tech school. The goal is to build an **IA** (Intelligent Agent) that could find it's way to the rewards to increase scores.

## Motivation
A great project to kick-start my coding journey and get the basic of algorithm.

## Build status
Passed by the Sentinel.
http://gitlab-students.int.intek.edu.vn/maze/mbach/blob/master/Passing%20the%20Sentinel

## Code style
PEP-8

## Screenshots

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Features
Can survive multiple harsh condition from you cruel users! >.<
+ Run in multi-player mode
+ Run in different map types and sizes
+ Survive even if other **IA** that other students developed try to kill it

## Code Example
```
$ head -1 maze_ia.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

$ ./maze /path/to/maze_ia.py

```
./maze --help
```

## Credits
Huge credits for the mentors and staffs at INTEK that assigned and assisted me on this project, as well as my fellow students. Without your valuable input, this project could never be completed in time.

## Credits
At the end of the week, an arena will be held in order to see which **IA** can survive the longest and is the most effective one. This is depends on which path-finding algorithms is the fastest and that cover all cases that could happen the best. Let's hope our **IA** will do well! (Updating soon!)
